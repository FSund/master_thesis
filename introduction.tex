\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Background and motivation}%
The goal of this master thesis is to study water trapped in nanoscale pores in solid silica, using numerical simulations.  

Silica is hydrophilic -- expect changes near surface -- measure as function of distance to matrix

\todoa{Why study this? See master }
% \todoa{Write about hydrophilic silica, distance to matrix effects, surface interaction}

To study water trapped in nanoporous silica we need to develop a reproducable method for generating realistic nanoporous silica, and methods for filling the nanoscale pores with water. We want to study the structure, behaviour and transport properties of water in silica, so we also need to find some appropriate way of quantifying and analyzing this. 

We know that silica is hydrophilic, so we expect the behaviour of water to change as we get closer to the silica matrix. We want to develop methods for accurately studying these surface effects.

\section*{Structure of the thesis}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Structure of the thesis}%
We start with a description of the numerical methods we will be using to study nanoporous silica and water. We then describe the methods we use for creating the systems we want to simulate and to measurements on, and finally we prepare, simulate, and do measurements on the systems. In the end we analyze the results, compare the measurements against each other, and draw some conclusions.
