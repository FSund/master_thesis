\chapter{Background and motivation}
The goal of this master thesis is to study water trapped in nanoscale pores in solid silica, using numerical simulations. To do this we need to first develop an reproducable method for generating realistic nanoporous silica, and methods for getting water into the pores. 

We want to study the structure, behaviour and transport properties of water in silica, so we need to find some appropriate way of quantifying and analyzing this.

\chapter{Introduction to the thesis}
We start with a description of the numerical methods we will be using to study nanoporous silica and water. We then describe the methods we use for creating such systems, and finally we prepare, simulate, and do measurements on the systems. The results are analyzed, and conclusions are drawn.\todoa{FIX THIS}
