\section{Density of water\label{sec:results_density}}
% We measure the density as function of distance to the matrix in all our systems. We ended up with ``bulk'' densities in the systems ranging from around 1000 kg/m$^3$ to 1150 kg/m$^3$, so for easier comparison we have normalized the densities against the bulk density in each system. Here we have defined the bulk density as the average density of water molecules more than $\sim 10\text{ \AA}$ from the nearest silicon atom. 

We have measured the density of water as function of distance to the silica matrix in all of our systems, averaged over 200 states for each system, with 100 timesteps of 0.050 picoseconds between each state (5 picoseconds between each state). The results are plotted in \crefrange{fig:first_density_fig}{fig:last_density_fig}. We measured for distances ranging from 0 to 10 \AA\ from the silica matrix, in steps of 0.25 \AA. We have also measured the bulk density in the systems where this was possible, the results of which are listed in \cref{tab:bulk_water_density}.%

The most significant trend we notice in \cref{fig:first_density_fig} is that the water density seems stable at 9-10 \AA\ from the silica matrix, but as we move closer than this we see a clear reduction in density. When we go from 10 \AA\ and move closer to the matrix we see in all systems that the density falls off at around 7-8 \AA\, and is reduced by almost 10\% at around 5 \AA. The density then increases to densities higher than the initial densities (the ones at 10 \AA) when we move towards 3 \AA. The relative reduction and then increase in density seems to be similar in all systems with similar overall densities, but in the systems with the highest overall density the relative change seems to be a bit smaller than in the other systems.

We now look at the density in the four reference systems, which is plotted in \cref{fig:density_reference_systems}. We see that the densities all have the same quantitative behaviour as we move further from the silica matrix, even though the net density is very different in the four systems, with the densities stabilizing at values ranging from 1050 to almost 1150 kg/m$^3$ at 8-10 \AA. One trend we notice is that the point where the density stabilizes, at around 7 \AA, seems to appear closer to the matrix when we increase the overall density. The minimum point seems to appear at approximately the same distance for the systems with a 86 \AA\ wide flat pore (system \#1 and \#2), but a bit closer to the matrix for the narrow flat pores (system \#4 and \#3).

In \cref{fig:density_rough_systems} we have plotted the density in the four random fracture systems. We see that the density in all four systems are very similar at all distances to the matrix, and that the density seems to stabilize between 1010 and 1025 kg/m$^3$ at 8-10 \AA\ from the silica matrix. We see that even though these four fractures have different geometries (especially system \#1 and \#2 are very different from system \#3 and \#4), the behaviour of the density as we go from 8 to 3 \AA\ from the silica matrix seems to be the same in all four systems. We also see that the density seems peak at around 8 \AA, and stabilize at a somewhat lower value as we go further from the silica matrix. This peak is similar to a peak observed around 5 \AA\ from the silica matrix by Bonnaud et al. in \cite{bonnaud2010molecular} (see Figure 6 in the article). In the article they use a different measure for the distance to the silica matrix, which might explain the difference in the distance at which the peak is observed.

We have estimated the bulk water density by the same technique we use for measuring water density as function of distance to the silica matrix, but now by averaging the density for all water-oxygen atoms further away from the silica matrix than a certain distance (typically 10 \AA\ or more), instead of using bins. This measurement requires that we have a fracture at least twice as wide as this distance to have any atoms we can measure the density of, so estimating the bulk density was only possible in reference system \#1 and \#2 with a flat, constant fracture of 86 \AA, and in the two random fractured systems \#1 and \#2, which have fractures with varying width. %We measured the bulk distance using a minimum distance to the matrix of 10 and 30 \AA\, to see if there was a difference between these two limits.%

The estimated bulk densities are listed in \cref{tab:bulk_water_density}, where we have measured the bulk density for water atoms at least 10 \AA\ and at least 30 \AA\ from the silica matrix. We see that the estimated bulk density does not change if we use 10 or 30 \AA\ as the minimum distance from the matrix, indicating that a limit of 10 \AA\ is probably safe. If we compare the bulk densities to the plots of the density as function of distance from the matrix in \cref{fig:density_reference_systems,fig:density_rough_systems}, we see that the density seems to be stable close to the bulk density at around 10 \AA.

When we compare rough and flat we see that the peak/fall-off appears further from the silica in rough than flat.
