We have do experiments on a total of 8 different systems, all consisting of a slab of silica with a fracture in the center filled with water. Four of them are ``reference'' systems with just a flat fracture in the center, and the other four are fractures contructed in different ways.

All systems are created using the experimental procedure from \cref{sec:experimental_procedure}. The systems are initialized as a perfect crystal of $\upbeta$-cristobalite. The system is then brought to 4500 Kelvin using a thermostat, to melt the silica crystal. It is then cooled back down to 300 Kelvin, and a fracture is cut out of the solid slab of silica, the system dangling ends are passivated, and the fracture is filled with water. The system is then thermalized at 300 Kelvin.

A summary of the different systems can be seen in \cref{tab:systems}, where we have listed the dimension, porosity, water density, and number of atoms in each system.

The fractures in the systems labelled ``rough fracture'' are all created using surfaces with a Hurst exponent close to \hl{0.75}, generated using the method from \cref{sec:diamond_square_2d_finite}, and cut out using the method from \cref{sec:generating_fractures}. Systems 1 and 2 are created using two different surfaces, where we create the fracture by putting one surface above the other, and cutting out the atoms in the space between them. Surface 3 and 4 are created using the same surface repeated twice for the top and bottom part of the fracture, with a distance of respectively 14.4 and 28.8 \AA\ between the surfaces.

        $\phi$ is the approximate porosity of the system, defined as the volume of the fracture relative to the volume of the whole system. $r$ is the distance between the surfaces used to create the fracture. $N$ is the total number of atoms (silicon, oxygen and hydrogen), $N_\text{SiO$_2$}$ is the number of SiO$_2$-units, and $N_\text{H$_2$O}$ is the number of water molecules. %
