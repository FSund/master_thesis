\chapter{Conclusion}
- small differences between flat and rough, and between the two rough types, but clear trends in water transport properties and structure (diff, TOP) near surface
- density 8-10 ang, diffusion and TOP 5-6 ang

important with density control in future experiments - new methods (use tetrahedra?)

\chapter{Future}
Measure in narrower fracture -- hard to initialize -- new inject methods
Better method for creating uniform width fractures? Since our method only creates equal $\Delta z$
