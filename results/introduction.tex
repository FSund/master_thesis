In this chapter we will present the procedure we have used when doing simulations, the systems we have studied, and the the results we have found. 

We start with a description of what steps we have used to generate a realistic nanoporous silica, with water in the pores. We describe how we create a \hl{random} fracture in a slab of silica, and the method we have developed for passivating the dangling ends after we cut out the fracture. We also describe a method for injecting water into the fracture.

After this we present the different measurements we have done during the simulations, how the measurements are done, and why we do them. We then describe the different systems we have generated, the characteristics of these systems, both in form of tables, and using renderings of visualizations of the systems.

Finally the results from all our simulations and measurements are presented and discussed. \todoa{Some more intro to results?}
