\chapter{Introduction}
In this chapter we will present the experimental procedure we have used when doing esperiments, the systems we have studied, and the the results we have found. 

We start with a description of what steps we have used to generate a realistic nanoporous silica, with water in the pores. We describe we have developed method for passivating the dangling ends after we cut out the fracture from a silica crystal, and a method for injecting water into the vacuum in the fracture.

After this we present the different measurements we have done during the experiments, how the measurements are done, and why we do them. We then describe the different systems we have generated, the characteristics of these systems, both in pure number form, and in renderings of visualizations of the systems.

Finally the results from all our experiments and measurements are presented and discussed. \todoa{something more about results?}
