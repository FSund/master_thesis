\chapter{Molecular dynamics program used for simulations}
% \todoa{Finish writing about sio2/water program}%
To study an advanced system like silica and water we need a more advanced potential than the Lennard-Jones potential. We know water likes to have a certain H-O-H angle, and that water molecules have strong hydrogen bonds between them that make water have some unique properties. Similarly we know that silica usually appears in tetrahedral structures, with certain Si-O-Si angles more stable than others. To simulate the forces that make structures like that appear we need to use something more advanced than a diatomic potential Lennard-Jones, so we use a higher order potential. We would also like to be able to simulate chemical reactions like transfer of oxygen atoms from silica to water, which requires further modifications of the simulations.

The potential implemented in the program we use in this thesis has been developed at the University of Southern California (USC) by P. Vashishta, Rajiv K. Kalia, Jos√© P. Rino and Ingvar Ebbsj\"o\cite{vashishta1990interaction} (see also\cite{shekhar2013nanobubble,shekhar2013nanobubble_supplements}). The potential contains two-body and three-body terms, and allows oxygen atoms to be transferred between silica and water. See \cref{sec:sio2_potential} for more details on the potential.

The potential is implemented in a \mono{FORTRAN 77} program, which has been parallellized and highly optimized for running on high-performance computing clusters like Abel. The program is unfortunately closed-source, and we are not allowed to distribute this openly.

The program implements both the fast and simple Berendsen thermostat and the more sophisticated Nos\'e-Hoover chains thermostat to simulate the $NPT$-ensemble, and a thermostat for the NPT ensemble. It also implements so-called variable time-step integrators, which saves CPU-time when we have silica and water in the same system. See \cref{sec:sio2_integrator} for more information about this.

An article where the program has been used to study silica and water can be seen in\cite{shekhar2013nanobubble}, where they do simulations of systems with 1 billion atoms. See also the supplements to the article\cite{shekhar2013nanobubble_supplements}.
