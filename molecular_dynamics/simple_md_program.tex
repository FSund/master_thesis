\chapter{A simple molecular dynamics model\label{chap:simple_md_program}}
In molecular dynamics we study systems of many interacting atoms and molecules by assuming that they behave classically, and solve Newton's equations of motion using an appropriate integration scheme to evolve the system in time. By assuming that the atoms behave classically we mean that we model the atoms as point particles, and characterize them using their position, $\bvec r$, velocity, $\bvec v$ and the force acting on them, $\bvec F$. The interactions between the atoms are described using potentials. It is into these potentials we bake the physical insight of the systems we want to simulate, which we often do by finding potentials using studies and simulations of the underlying quantum mechanical nature of the interactions between the atoms in the system, and also by comparing with results from experimental studies.
