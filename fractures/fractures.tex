\chapter{Introduction}
We want to study the behaviour of water trapped in nanoscale (pores and) fractures in silica, so need want a way to generate and characterize such a structure. (Several methods of characterizing a fracture could be imagined (\hl{SOURCES, examples}), and we will use several of them.)

\chapter{Characterization}

An \emph{affine transformation} transforms a point $\bvec x = (x_1, \dots, x_n)$ into new points $\bvec x' = (r_1x_1, \dots, r_n, x_n)$, where the scaling rations $r_1, \dots, r_n$ are \emph{not} all equal.

A bounded set $\mathcal{S}$ is \emph{self-affine} if $\mathcal{S}$ is the union of $N$ non-overlapping subsets $\mathcal{S}_1, \dots, \mathcal{S}_N$, each of which is congruent to the set $\bvec r(\mathcal{S})$ obtained from $\mathcal S$ by the affine transform defined by $\bvec r$. Here \emph{congruent} means that the set of points $\mathcal{S}$ is identical to the set of points $\bvec r(\mathcal{S})$ after possible translations and/or rotations of the set\cite{feder1988fractals}.

A set $\mathcal{S}$ is \emph{statistically self-affine} if $\mathcal{S}$ is the union of $N$ non-overlapping subsets each of which is scaled down by $\bvec r$ from the original, and is identical in all statistical respects to $\bvec r(\mathcal{S})$.

One common method to characterize fractals is by the Hurst exponent, usually called $H$\footnote{\todo[inline]{The name used by Hurst in his work where he first describes the exponent was actually $K$\cite{hurst1965longterm}\cite{hurst1951longterm}}}, which comes from a statistical method developed by Hurst\cite{hurst1965longterm}\cite{hurst1951longterm}. The Hurst exponent is related to the fractal dimension $D$ by
\begin{align*}
    D = d-H,
\end{align*}
where $d$ is the spatial dimension of the fractal's domain\cite{feder1988fractals}.

The statistical method developed by Hurst is called \emph{rescaled range analysis} and was designed for use on 1-dimensional time series $f(t)$. The method has been generalized to higher dimensions\cite{fan2013rescaled}, but the original 1D form is shown here.
