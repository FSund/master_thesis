\section{Detrending moving average}
To estimate the Hurst exponent of a surface we use a method called detrending moving average (DMA) first described by E. Alessio, A. Carbone et al.\cite{alessio2002dma}, and later generalized to higher dimensions by A. Carbone \cite{carbone2007algorithm}. 

After trying out some different methods for estimating the Hurst exponent, we ended up choosing this method both because it is \hl{easy} to understand and implement, and because it has been shown to give good results, as we will also confirm later. A more detailed comparison of different methods for estimating the Hurst exponent can be seen in\cite{shao2012comparing}, where they find that DMA and DFA (detrended fluctuation analysis) overall perform better than FA (fluctuation analysis), also being less sensitive to the choice of scaling range.

\subsection{Detrending moving average in 2 dimensions}
% We define a \hl{(self-affine)} surface $f(i,j)$, where $f$ is the height in the point $(i,j)$, defined in a discrete 2-dimensional domain with size $N\times N$, for $i,j = 1,\dots,N$. We divide this surface into \emph{overlapping} subsurfaces of size $n \times n$, spanning the whole surface. The \hl{lower left} corners of the surfaces are located in the points $(i,j)$ for $i,j = 1,\dots, N-n+1$ (the limits are set so that the subsurfaces stay within the domain of the surface). In each surface we find a point $(k,l) = (n-m,n-m)$ (relative to lower bottom corner of subsurface)

We define a \hl{(self-affine)} surface $f(i,j)$ of size $N,N$, with $i,j \in [1,N]$. For each point $i,j \in [1,N-n+1]$ in this surface we define a subsurface of size $n\times n$, where each subsurface consists if the points
\begin{align*}
%     (k,l) = \left([i, \dots, i+n], [j, \dots, j+n]\right)%
%     (k,l) = (i,j) + ([1\dots,n], [1,\dots,n])%
    (k,l) = (i,j) + \left([1\dots,n], [1,\dots,n]\right)%
\end{align*}
in the main surface. This means that the point $(i,j)$ is located in the \hl{``lower left''} corner of the subsurface, that the subsurfaces overlap, and that they together span the whole main surface. The limits $i,j \in [1,N-n+1]$ are set so that all subsurfaces are in the main surface.

For each subsurface located at $(i,j)$ we find a point $(k_m, l_m)$ in the subsurface, which can be written as
\begin{align}
%     (k^*, l^*) = (i,j) + (n-m, n-m) %
%     (k_0, l_0) = (i,j) + (n-m, n-m) %
    (k_m, l_m) = (i,j) + (n-m, n-m), %
%     \\
%     \big(i+(n-m), j+(n-m)\big)
    \label{eq:dma_point_in_subsurface}
\end{align}
where $m$ is defined as
\begin{align*}
    &m = \lfloor n\theta \rfloor &\text{for } \theta \in [0,1).
\end{align*}
% With $\theta = 0$ the point is in the upper right corner of the subsurfaces, at $(i+n,i+n)$, for $\theta = 1/2$ the point is in the center, at $(i+n/2, i+n/2)$, and for $\theta \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow (n-1)/n$ the point is in the lower left corner, at $(i,j)$.
The parameter $\theta$ controls the position of this point inside the subsurface, and we have three extreme cases, listed below, and illustrated in \cref{fig:DMA_theta}.%

We find the average $\bar {f_n}$ of each subsurface \hl{using}
\begin{align}
    \bar {f_n}(i,j) = \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{k = i}^{i+n} \sum_{l = j}^{j+n} f(k,l),
    \label{eq:carbone_average}
\end{align}
and we define the \emph{generalized variance}, $\sigma_\text{DMA}^2$, as \hl{the sum of the squared differences between} the value in the point $f(k_m,l_m)$ minus the average $\bar {f_n}(i,j)$, for each subsurface. This can be written as
\begin{align}
    \sigma_\text{DMA}^2 
%     &= \frac{1}{(N-n)^2}\sum_{i=n-m}^{N-m} ~ \sum_{j=n-m}^{N-m} 
%     \big(
%         f(i,j) - \tilde f_n(i,j)
%     \big)^2,% \label{eq:dma_variance}
%     \\
    &= \frac{1}{(N-n)^2}\sum_{i=1}^{N-n+1} ~ \sum_{j=1}^{N-n+1} 
    \big(
        f(k_m,j_m) - \bar f_n(i,j)
    \big)^2%
%     \qquad\text{for } k_m, j_m \text{as in \cref{eq:dma_point_in_subsurface}}%
    \nonumber\\%
    &= \frac{1}{(N-n)^2}\sum_{i=1}^{N-n+1} ~ \sum_{j=1}^{N-n+1} 
    \big(
        f(i+n-m,j+n-m) - \bar f_n(i,j)
    \big)^2.
    \label{eq:dma_variance}
\end{align}

It can be shown that this generalized variance has a power-law dependence on $n$ \cite{alessio2002dma,carbone2007algorithm}, which goes as
\begin{align*}
    \sigma_\text{DMA}^2 \sim \left(2n^2\right)^H.
\end{align*}
We can use this dependence to estimate the Hurst exponent $H$, by calculating $\sigma_\text{DMA}^2$ for different sizes of the subsurfaces, $n$. We estimate $H$ by a linear fit of $\log \left(\sigma_\text{DMA}\right)^2$ against $\log \left(2n^2 \right)$, where $H$ is the slope of this fit.

In the paper by Anna Carbone that generalizes DMA to higher dimensions\cite{carbone2007algorithm} they use different parameters for each spatial dimension $d$, $\bvec\theta = \theta_1, \dots, \theta_d$ and $\bvec{n} = n_1, \dots, n_d$, but for simplicity and to avoid \hl{strange/spurious?} results, we use $\theta_1 = \theta_2 = \theta$ and $n_1 = n_2 = n$.

A modification of the method mentioned is replacing $\bar f_n(i,j)$ in \cref{eq:dma_variance} with\todo{not correct, fix this}
\begin{align*}
    \bar {f_n}^*(i,j) = (1-\alpha) f_n(i,j) + \alpha \bar {f_n}(i-1,j-1),
\end{align*}
where
\[
    \alpha = n^2/(n+1)^2,
\]
and $\tilde f_n(i,j)$ has the same form as before (see \cref{eq:carbone_average}). To use this modification we also have to change the limits in \cref{eq:dma_variance} from ${i,j\in [1,N-n+1]}$ to $i,j\in [2,N-n+1]$. This modification has been shown to give better results for small systems\cite{carbone2007algorithm}\todo{why?}, and since we are usually generating surfaces with a \hl{resolution/$N$ of 100-200}, we use this modified method in our implementation of the method. \todo{maybe implement both methods?}

\orangebox{The method is implemented in Matlab/Octave}

\subsection{The performance of detrending moving average}
To verify that the method we used for estimating the Hurst exponent worked as intended, and gave good results, we ran a series of tests using synthetic (1D) time series and (2D) surfaces \hl{of fractional Brownian motion} with a known Hurst exponent. When doing these tests we soon realized that a big problem with synthesizing time series and surfaces with a given Hurst exponent is that it's both hard to accurately measure the exponent, and it's hard to synthesize data with a given exponent. \hl{This means that when testing methods for analysing and synthesizing signals, you never know if it's you measuring method, or your synthesizing method that is causing problems if things aren't working as intended.}

To reduce the sources of errors we used a lot of different ready-made methods for synthesizing data with a given Hurst exponent, and measured the exponent using the detrending moving average method for each of these methods. For synthesizing 1D data we used the built-in Matlab-function \hl{cite matlab?} \Verb!wfbm! which uses the algorithm proposed by Abry and Sellan \cite{abry1996wavelet}, and two methods from the Matlab-toolbox FracLab\cite{fraclab_toolbox}, \Verb!fbmwoodchan! which uses a method propoesed in\cite{wood1994simulation}, and \Verb!fbmlevinson! which uses a method from\cite{levinson1947wiener}. \hl{Readymade} programs for generating 2D data with a given Hurst exponent is hard to find \hl{(which is part of the reason why we implemented the SRA method)}, but we used another function from FracLab called \Verb!synth2!, which, according to the documentation of the function:%
\begin{quote}
    ``Generates a 2D Fractional Brownian Motion (fBm) using an incremental Fourier Method for processes with stationary increments of order (0,1) and (1,0)''.
\end{quote}
% ``Generates a 2D Fractional Brownian Motion (fBm) using an incremental Fourier Method for processes with stationary increments of order (0,1) and (1,0)''.

See \cref{fig:dma_performace} for a plot of Hurst exponent measured using \hl{DMA} as a function of the exponent used as input for the four different methods for generating synthetic data above, for three different values of the parameter $\theta$.

From \cref{fig:dma_performace} we conclude that $\theta = 0.0$ seems to give the best and most consistent results, as also noted by Gao-Feng Gu and Wei-Xing Zhou in\cite{gu2010detrending}, where they further develop the \hl{DMA} method to analyse multifractals. \hl{We would liked to have more 2D data references.}%
