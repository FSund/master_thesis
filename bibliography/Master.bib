@article{bonnaud2010molecular,
abstract = {This paper reports on a molecular simulation study of the thermodynamics, structure and dynamics of water confined at ambient temperature in hydroxylated silica nanopores of a width H = 10 and 20 \AA. The adsorption isotherms for water in these nanopores resemble those observed for experimental samples; the adsorbed amount increases continuously in the multilayer adsorption regime until a jump occurs due to capillary condensation of the fluid within the pore. Strong layering of water in the vicinity of the silica surfaces is observed as marked density oscillations are observed up to 8 \AA from the surface in the density profiles for confined water. Our results indicate that water molecules within the first adsorbed layer tend to adopt a H-down orientation with respect to the silica substrate. For all pore sizes and adsorbed amounts, the self-diffusivity of confined water is lower than the bulk, due to the hydrophilic interaction between the water molecules and the hydroxylated silica surface. Our results also suggest that the self-diffusivity of confined water is sensitive to the adsorbed amount.},

@article{fournier1982computer,
abstract = {A recurrent problem in generating realistic pictures by computers is to represent natural irregular objects and phenomena without undue time or space overhead. We develop a new and powerful solution to this computer graphics problem by modeling objects as sample paths of stochastic processes. Of particular interest are those stochastic processes which previously have been found to be useful models of the natural phenomena to be represented. One such model applicable to the representation of terrains, known as ” fractional Brownian motion,” has been developed by Mandelbrot.The value of a new approach to object modeling in computer graphics depends largely on the efficiency of the techniques used to implement the model. We introduce a new algorithm that computes a realistic, visually satisfactory approximation to fractional Brownian motion in faster time than with exact calculations. A major advantage of this technique is that it allows us to compute the surface to arbitrary levels of details without increasing the database. Thus objects with complex appearances can be displayed from a very small database. The character of the surface can be controlled by merely modifying a few parameters. A similar change allows complex motion to be created inexpensively.},

@article{kumar2009tetrahedral,
abstract = {We introduce the space-dependent correlation function C (Q)(r) and time-dependent autocorrelation function C (Q)(t) of the local tetrahedral order parameter Q identical with Q(r,t). By using computer simulations of 512 waterlike particles interacting through the transferable interaction potential with five points (TIP5 potential), we investigate C (Q)(r) in a broad region of the phase diagram. We find that at low temperatures C (Q)(t) exhibits a two-step time-dependent decay similar to the self-intermediate scattering function and that the corresponding correlation time tau(Q) displays a dynamic cross-over from non-Arrhenius behavior for T > T (W) to Arrhenius behavior for T < T (W), where T (W) denotes the Widom temperature where the correlation length has a maximum as T is decreased along a constant-pressure path. We define a tetrahedral entropy S (Q) associated with the local tetrahedral order of water molecules and find that it produces a major contribution to the specific heat maximum at the Widom line. Finally, we show that tau(Q) can be extracted from S (Q) by using an analog of the Adam-Gibbs relation.},

@article{gu2010detrending,
abstract = {The detrending moving average (DMA) algorithm is a widely used technique to quantify the long-term correlations of nonstationary time series and the long-range correlations of fractal surfaces, which contains a parameter $\theta$ determining the position of the detrending window. We develop multifractal detrending moving average (MFDMA) algorithms for the analysis of one-dimensional multifractal measures and higher-dimensional multifractals, which is a generalization of the DMA method. The performance of the one-dimensional and two-dimensional MFDMA methods is investigated using synthetic multifractal measures with analytical solutions for backward ($\theta$=0), centered ($\theta$=0.5), and forward ($\theta$=1) detrending windows. We find that the estimated multifractal scaling exponent $\tau$(q) and the singularity spectrum f($\alpha$) are in good agreement with the theoretical values. In addition, the backward MFDMA method has the best performance, which provides the most accurate estimates of the scaling exponents with lowest error bars, while the centered MFDMA method has the worse performance. It is found that the backward MFDMA algorithm also outperforms the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis. The one-dimensional backward MFDMA method is applied to analyzing the time series of Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index and its multifractal nature is confirmed.},

@article{csaszar2005equilibrium,
abstract = {Equilibrium structures are fundamental entities in molecular sciences. They can be inferred from experimental data by complicated inverse procedures which often rely on several assumptions, including the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Theory provides a direct route to equilibrium geometries. A recent high-quality ab initio semiglobal adiabatic potential-energy surface (PES) of the electronic ground state of water, reported by Polyansky et al. [ ibid. 299, 539 (2003)] and called CVRQD here, is analyzed in this respect. The equilibrium geometries resulting from this direct route are deemed to be of higher accuracy than those that can be determined by analyzing experimental data. Detailed investigation of the effect of the breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation suggests that the concept of an isotope-independent equilibrium structure holds to about 3 x 10(-5) A and 0.02 degrees for water. The mass-independent [Born-Oppenheimer (BO)] equilibrium bond length and bond angle on the ground electronic state PES of water is r(e) (BO)=0.957 82 A and theta e (BO)=104.48(5) degrees , respectively. The related mass-dependent (adiabatic) equilibrium bond length and bond angle of H2 (16)O is r(e) (ad)=0.957 85 A and theta e (ad)=104.50(0) degrees , respectively, while those of D2 (16)O are r(e) (ad)=0.957 83 A and theta e (ad)=104.49(0) degrees . Pure ab initio prediction of J=1 and 2 rotational levels on the vibrational ground state by the CVRQD PESs is accurate to better than 0.002 cm(-1) for all isotopologs of water considered. Elaborate adjustment of the CVRQD PESs to reproduce all observed rovibrational transitions to better than 0.05 cm(-1) (or the lower ones to better than 0.0035 cm(-1)) does not result in noticeable changes in the adiabatic equilibrium structure parameters. The expectation values of the ground vibrational state rotational constants of the water isotopologs, computed in the Eckart frame using the CVRQD PESs and atomic masses, deviate from the experimentally measured ones only marginally, especially for A0 and B0. The small residual deviations in the effective rotational constants are due to centrifugal distortion, electronic, and non-Born-Oppenheimer effects. The spectroscopic (nonadiabatic) equilibrium structural parameters of H2 16O, obtained from experimentally determined A'0 and B'0 rotational constants corrected empirically to obtain equilibrium rotational constants, are r(e) (sp)=0.957 77 A and theta e (sp)=104.48 degrees .},

In the method, a molecular dynamics calculation is used to calculate the average potential energy of a cluster of molecules as a function of temperature, and the equilibrium constants are calculated from the integral of the energy with respect to reciprocal temperature. The method is illustrated by calculations of the equilibrium constants for the formation of clusters of two to five water molecules that interact with each other by an intermolecular potential devised by Watts. The method is compared with other procedures for calculating the thermodynamic properties of clusters. I.},

@article{shao2012comparing,
abstract = {Notwithstanding the significant efforts to develop estimators of long-range correlations (LRC) and to compare their performance, no clear consensus exists on what is the best method and under which conditions. In addition, synthetic tests suggest that the performance of LRC estimators varies when using different generators of LRC time series. Here, we compare the performances of four estimators [Fluctuation Analysis (FA), Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), Backward Detrending Moving Average (BDMA), and Centred Detrending Moving Average (CDMA)]. We use three different generators [Fractional Gaussian Noises, and two ways of generating Fractional Brownian Motions]. We find that CDMA has the best performance and DFA is only slightly worse in some situations, while FA performs the worst. In addition, CDMA and DFA are less sensitive to the scaling range than FA. Hence, CDMA and DFA remain "The Methods of Choice" in determining the Hurst index of time series.},

@article{zhou2005comparison,
abstract = {Fractal geometry has been actively researched in a variety of disciplines. The essential concept of fractal analysis is fractal dimension. It is easy to compute the fractal dimension of truly self-similar objects. Difficulties arise, however, when we try to compute the fractal dimension of surfaces that are not strictly self-similar. A number of fractal surface dimension estimators have been developed. However, different estimators lead to different results. In this paper, we compared five fractal surface dimension estimators (triangular prism, isarithm, variogram, probability, and variation) using surfaces generated from three surface generation algorithms (shear displacement, Fourier filtering, and midpoint displacement). We found that in terms of the standard deviations and the root mean square errors, the triangular prism and isarithm estimators perform the best among the five methods studied.},

@article{carpenter1980computer,
abstract = {Fractals are a class of highly irregular shapes that have myriad counterparts in the real world, such as islands, river networks, turbulence, and snowflakes. Classic frac- tals include Brownian paths, Cantor sets, and plane-filling curves. Nearly all fractal sets are of fractional dimension and all are nowhere differentiable. Previously published procedures for calculating fractal curves employ shear displacement processes, modified Markov processes, and inverse Fourier transforms. They are either very expensive or very complex and do not easily generalize to surfaces. This paper presents a family of simple methods for generating and displaying a wide class of fractal curves and surfaces. In so doing, it introduces the concept of statistical subdivision in which a geometric entity is split into smaller entities while preserving certain statistical properties.},
