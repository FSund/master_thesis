We have now developed a molecular dynamics program that can do realistic simulations of water, silica, and model the interactions between water and silica. We have developed methods for initializing nanoporous silica systems, with randomly generated rough fractures in them, and methods for injecting water into these pores.

We know that the hydrophilic nature of silica creates some interactions between water and silica, and it is the effect of these interactions we want to study. We expect these interactions to have short-range effects on the water, so calculating averages for all water atoms seems like a bad approach, since the fine details of what happens with water near the silica surface will be lost. To be able to study the water-silica interface we thus need to find ways to find and do measurements on the water molecules near the silica surface.
