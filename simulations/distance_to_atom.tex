\section{Distance to nearest atom\label{sec:distance_to_atom}}
To help visualize and characterize our nanoporous system we developed a program that creates a 3d map of the distance to the nearest atom, in each point in space on a regular grid. The implementation of this program is almost straighforward, but since we have to do a lot of calculations if we want to have a map with decent resolution, we have also parallellized the program to reduce the computation time.
